This directory contains code that directly generates a software package called
~flowcut~, using [[https://github.com/jacobbien/litr-project][litr]]. Each R Markdown document in this directory contain code
that directly builds the R package.

The resulting R package is in the subdirectory [[./flowcut]], and can be
installed as follows.
