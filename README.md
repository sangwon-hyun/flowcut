flowcut: mixture modeling for censored spatiotemporal flow cytometry data.
=============

This package implements a Bayesian hierarchical mixture model for flow cytometry
data that is (1) observed gradually over time or space, and (2) subject to
*censoring* at the edges (hence the name `flowcut`).  The main motivating data
application is continuous-time flow cytometry data collected in the ocean, over
space and time.
